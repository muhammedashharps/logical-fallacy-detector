fallacies = {
    "Circular reasoning": "Circular reasoning occurs when the premise of an argument is used to support itself.\n\nExample: The President of the United States is a good leader (claim), because they are the leader of this country ",
    "Fallacy of logic": "The term 'fallacy of logic' is not a specific fallacy but may refer to various errors in logical reasoning. It lacks a clear definition in logical fallacies.\n\n This term lacks a specific example due to its general nature.",
    "Equivocation": "Equivocation involves using ambiguous language or shifting the meaning of a term within an argument.\n\nExample: An example is claiming that a feather is 'light' and therefore cannot be 'dark.'",
    "Fallacy of credibility": "This fallacy involves relying too heavily on the credibility of a source without considering the actual evidence or argument presented.\n\nExample: For instance, trusting a news article solely because it's from a reputable source.",
    "Ad populum": "Ad populum, or the bandwagon fallacy, occurs when someone appeals to popular beliefs or opinions to support an argument.\n\nExample: An example is believing something is true because everyone else does.",
    "Fallacy of extension": "This fallacy involves making unwarranted generalizations or assumptions about a group based on the characteristics of a few members.\n\nExample: For example, assuming all politicians are corrupt based on a few scandals.",
    "Intentional": "The term 'intentional' is not a specific fallacy but may refer to arguments made with deliberate deception or manipulation. It relates to the intention behind making an argument.\n\nExample: This term lacks a specific example due to its general nature.",
    "Faulty generalization": "Faulty generalization is the act of drawing a conclusion about an entire group based on insufficient or biased evidence.\n\nExample: For instance, concluding that everyone from a city is rude based on a couple of encounters.",
    "Appeal to emotion": "Appeal to emotion involves manipulating emotions to win an argument rather than relying on valid reasoning.\n\nExample: An example is urging support for a policy by evoking fear for innocent children.",
    "Fallacy of relevance": "The fallacy of relevance occurs when arguments are presented that are not pertinent to the topic under discussion.\n\nExample: For example, bringing up unrelated issues during a climate change debate.",
    "False dilemma": "A false dilemma, or false dichotomy, is presented when only two options are offered when there are more possible alternatives.\n\nExample: For instance, saying, 'You're either with us or against us.'",
    "Ad hominem": "Ad hominem attacks the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself.\n\nExample: An example is dismissing a scientist's research because of personal dislike.",
    "False causality": "False causality is the assumption that because one event followed another, the first event caused the second.\n\nExample: For example, wearing a red shirt and then your team winning, assuming the shirt caused the victory.",
    "Miscellaneous": "The 'miscellaneous' category is a catch-all for various fallacies that do not fit neatly into other categories. It includes arguments that may contain multiple fallacies, making them challenging to address directly.\n\nExample: An example is an argument containing various fallacies that make it hard to address directly."
